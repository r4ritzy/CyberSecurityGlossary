##Cyber Security

Imagine you have a computer or a smartphone, and you use them to play games, chat with friends, and do schoolwork. But just like in the real world, there are bad people in the digital world too. They might try to steal your personal information, like passwords or photos, or mess up your computer or online accounts.

Cybersecurity is like having a digital shield to protect yourself from these bad people and their tricks. It's a set of tools, practices, and rules to keep your devices and information safe from hackers and cybercriminals.
